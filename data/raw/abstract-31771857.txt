An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as a response to a medicinal product 
which is noxious and unintended. ADRs are an important cause of morbidity and 
mortality and increase health costs. The pharmacovigilance systems allow the 
identification and prevention of the risks associated with use of a drug, 
especially of recently marketed drugs; they detect signals from data of the 
global ADR register and also support decisions taken by regulatory agencies in 
different countries. Only a few drugs are withdrawn from the market, mainly due 
to hepatotoxicity. Spontaneous notification of ADR is the cheapest, simplest and 
most used method to recognize new safety drug problems, under-reporting being 
its main limitation. The future of pharmacovigilance and ADRs will include a 
higher involvement of patients, doctors, health authorities and pharmaceutical 
companies, and the use of new technologies.
